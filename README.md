# Deboning Chicken Thighs

This is just a note to myself (and maybe others) that when you buy bone-in skin-on (BISO) chicken
thighs, your yield of thigh meat will be roughly **70%** of the total weight of the thigh.

When you're in the grocery store, comparing the price BISO chicken thighs to its boneless skinless
(BLSL) counterpart is difficult because you do not know how much meat exists in the former. And
almost always, strangely, BISO thighs are cheaper per pound.

Therefore, I performed a test with about 8 pounds and these are my results:

| Product          | Measurement |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Skin             | 575 grams   |
| Bone             | 510 grams   |
| Meat             | 2,394 grams |
| Total Non-meat   | 1,085 grams |
| Total            | 3,479 grams |
| Non-meat / Total | 31.19%      |
| Meat / Total     | 68.81%      |

The last line there is where "roughly **70%**" from above is derived from. Of course, you may even
get a different yield depending on your knife skills, time invested, chicken cuts, etc.

In conclusion, if you're only targeting meat:

- If `BISO price/pound รท 0.7` is less than `BLSL price/pound`, then its a a good deal to buy the
  BISO.
- If you need `n` pounds of thigh meat from bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, buy `n รท 0.7` pounds.

On the downside, deboning requires time, practice, and perhaps, a boning knife. This is what you're
paying for in the difference between the two prices.

But, on the upside, you can hone your knife skills and get some good by-products:

- With bones, I make [stock](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe)
  out of them.
- With the skins, I fry them into
  [cracklings](https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/fried-chicken-skin-cracklings/).
- With the fat, I render it down in a pan, let it cool, store in a jar in the refrigerator, and then
  use it in place of vegetable oil. (A lot of fat renders when making cracklings.)

These are actually pretty nice if your home-cooking cuisine calls for them.

It's pretty interesting this pricing model values the convenience of BLSL chicken so much that
something less complete is sold for more money, especially when the chicken farm is double-dipping
by selling those by-products to someone else.
