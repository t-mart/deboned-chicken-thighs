# Deboning Chicken Thighs

This is just a note to myself (and maybe others) that when you buy bone-in skin-on chicken thighs,
your yield of thigh meat will be roughly **70%** of the total weight of the thigh.

When you're in the grocery store, comparing the price bone-in skin-on chicken to it's boneless
skinless counterpart is difficult because you do not know how much meat exists in the former.
Therefore, I performed a test with about 8 pounds and these are my results:

| Product          | Measurement |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Skin             | 575 grams   |
| Bone             | 510 grams   |
| Meat             | 2,394 grams |
| Total Non-meat   | 1,085 grams |
| Total            | 3,479 grams |
| Non-meat / Total | 31.19%      |
| Meat / Total     | 68.81%      |

The last line there is where "roughly **70%**" from above is derived from.

In conclusion:

- If `bone-in skin-on price/pound รท 0.7` is less than `boneless skinless price/pound`, then its a a
  good deal to buy the bone-in skin on.
- If you need `n` pounds of thigh meat from bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, buy `n รท 0.7` pounds.

On the downside, you have to put time into deboning which requires time, some practice, and
optionally, a boning knife. This is what you're paying for in the difference between the two prices.

But, on the upside, you can hone your knife skills and get some good by-products:

- With bones, I make [stock](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-rich-easy-white-chicken-stock-recipe)
  out of them.
- With the skins, I fry them into
  [cracklings](https://www.lowcarbmaven.com/fried-chicken-skin-cracklings/).
- With the fat, I render it down in a pan, let it cool, store in a jar in the refrigerator, and then
  use it in place of vegetable oil. (A lot of fat renders when making cracklings.)
